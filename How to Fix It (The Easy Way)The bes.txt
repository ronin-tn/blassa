How to Fix It (The Easy Way)The best and most robust way to fix this
 is to use Android Studio's built-in Image Asset Studio to generate a new, 
 proper set of app icons. This will create all the necessary files in the correct 
 folders and automatically update your AndroidManifest.xml to point to them.1.
 Open the Asset Studio:•In the Project panel on the left, right-click on your 
 app folder (or the res folder).•Go to New > Image Asset.2.Configure 
 Your Icon:•In the "Icon Type" dropdown, make sure Launcher Icons 
 (Adaptive & Legacy) is selected.•Give your icon a name. 
 The default ic_launcher is standard, so you can keep 
 it.•In the "Foreground Layer" and "Background Layer" tabs, you can 
 choose a source image (like your logo) or a simple color. This is 
 how you design your app icon.•Adjust the "Resize" slider to make
  sure your logo fits well within the safe zone.Configure 
  Icon3.Generate the Icons:•Click Next. The tool will 
  show you a preview of all the icon files it's about to create for different Android versions and screen densities (mdpi, hdpi, xxxhdpi, etc.).•Click Finish.Android Studio will now perform two key actions:•It will create all the required ic_launcher.png and ic_launcher_round.png files and place them in the correct res/mipmap-* folders.•It will ensure your AndroidManifest.xml is correctly configured to use these newly created icons.4.Clean and Rebuild Your Project:•From the top menu, go to Build > Clean Project.•Then, go to Build > Rebuild Project.This will force Gradle to re-run the build process from scratch, and the resource linking error should now be gone.Alternative (Manual) FixIf you already have icon files and just want to fix the reference, you can do it manually:1.Check your res folder: Look inside all the app/src/main/res/mipmap-* folders. See what your icon files are actually named. For instance, maybe you named them my_app_icon.png instead of ic_launcher.png.2.Update AndroidManifest.xml: Open app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and find the android:icon and android:roundIcon attributes inside the <application> tag. Change the value to match the actual name of your icon files.For example, if your icon is named my_app_icon.png, change this:Manifest<!-- This is causing the error -->
<application
    ...
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round">Merge Into ManifestTo this:Manifest<!-- This is the fix -->
<application
    ...android:icon="@mipmap/my_app_icon"
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/my_app_icon_round">Merge Into ManifestWhile this works, using the Image Asset Studio is strongly recommended as it ensures you have properly configured icons for all device types.
